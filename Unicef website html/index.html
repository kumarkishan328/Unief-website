		        				When 13 year old Rinky of flood-ravaged Supaul district in Bihar told bluntly to his father that he shouldn't be eating food without washing his hands properly, he couldn't believe his ears.<br /><br />
								Rinky is a student of the Naya Jeevan Abhiyan-  a life saving skills programme initiated by Bihar Government and supported by UNICEF. <br /><br />
								Rinky was initially inattentive and rarely participated in activities during the first two days. But she suddenly broke out of her shell when the school made the students play games like, knotting and un-knotting a rope, to emphasise problem solving skills. Rinky began to actively participate in other games as well and she became more confident.  In fact, she became the lead-singer in her group for the rest of the training period.<br /><br />
								The programme runs for four days and includes discussions on day-to-day activities, the level of knowledge about hygiene, keeping books and personal belongings properly, positive thinking and more.<br /><br />
								For Rinky and 28 girls like her attending the, Life Skills Training, sessions, life has more to offer than staring blankly at the chaos around them. They look forward to a new tomorrow.<br /><br />
